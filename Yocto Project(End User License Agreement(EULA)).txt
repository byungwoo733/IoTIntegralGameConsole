READ THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT (THE "AGREEMENT") CAREFULLY BEFORE
DOWNLOADING OR INSTALLING JROCKIT. BY DOWNLOADING OR INSTALLING
JROCKIT, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. INDICATE YOUR
ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS BY SELECTING THE "ACCEPT" BUTTON AT THE END
OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, SELECT
THE "REJECT" BUTTON AT THE END OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE DOWNLOAD AND
INSTALLATION PROCESS WILL NOT CONTINUE.


1.  License to Use. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including but not limited to the restrictions set forth in
Section 4 (Restrictions), below, BEA Systems, Inc. ("BEA") grants you
a non-exclusive and non-transferable license for the internal use only
of the accompanying software and documentation provided by BEA for
JRockit ("JRockit"), including, but not limited to the right to
reproduce and use JRockit internally for the purpose of designing,
developing and testing Java applets and applications, and running Java
applets and applications on JRockit.

2.  License to Distribute. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and subject to the express condition precedent that you
first comply with the requirements of Section 3 (Reporting
Requirements) prior to exercising any rights granted under this
Section 2, BEA grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited
license to reproduce and distribute JRockit in binary form only,
provided that: (i) you distribute JRockit complete and unmodified,
(ii) you do not remove or alter any proprietary legends or notices
contained in or on JRockit, (iii) you only distribute JRockit pursuant
to a license agreement that protects BEA's and its licensors'
interests consistent with the terms contained in the Agreement, and
(iv) you agree to defend and indemnify BEA and its licensors from and
against any damages, costs, liabilities, settlement amounts and/or
expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any
claim, lawsuit or action by any third party that arises or results
from the use or distribution of JRockit distributed by you,

3.  Reporting Requirements.  Your right to distribute JRockit as
provided in Section 2, above, is expressly conditioned on your prior
compliance with the reporting obligations set forth in this Section 3.
Unless you first comply with these reporting requirements you may not
distribute JRockit in any manner.  Prior to distributing JRockit in
accordance with Section 2, you must provide BEA (via e-mail sent to
jrockit-partner@bea.com) with the following information: (i) your
name, (ii) place of incorporation or organization if a legal entity
such as a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, (iii)
the address of your residence or principal place of business if you
are a legal entity, (iv) the name of a designated contact person who
is authorized to receive information related to JRockit on your
behalf, (v) that designated contact's telephone number, fax number and
e-mail address, and (vi) your URL if you have one.

4.  Restrictions. JRockit is confidential to BEA and protected by
Copyright and other bodies of law protecting intellectual property
rights. Title to JRockit and all associated intellectual property
rights is retained by BEA and/or its licensors. JRockit includes
certain JRockit-specific diagnostics and management tools (including,
but not limited to, the JRockit Runtime Analyzer Tool and the Memory
Leak Diagnostics feature), and JRockit-specific monitoring and
management APIs identified in Exhibit A attached to this Agreement
(collectively "JRockit Management Functions"). You may use such
JRockit Management Functions and the corresponding data gathered from
the JRockit Java Virtual Machine through use of such JRockit
Management Functions solely for purposes of evaluation of such JRockit
Management Functions.  If you wish to use the JRockit Management
Functions other than for evaluation purposes, you must obtain a
separate license to do so from BEA or one of its licensees authorized
to grant such rights.  Except as specifically authorized in Sections 1
and 2, above, you may not make copies of JRockit. Unless enforcement
is prohibited by applicable law, you may not modify, decompile, or
reverse engineer JRockit. No right, title or interest in or to any
trademark, service mark, logo or trade name of BEA or its licensors is
granted under this Agreement.  JRockit is not designed, licensed or
intended for use in the design, construction, operation or maintenance
of any nuclear facility, nor may you use it for such purposes.  If the
version of JRockit you are licensing under this Agreement is a "
pre-final," "beta," "technology preview," or similar pre-production
release (collectively, "Pre-final Versions"), you must discontinue
your use of the Pre-final Version and replace each copy of such
Pre-Final Version with the successor general availability release as
soon as it becomes available from BEA. "Pre-final Versions" do not
include versions of JRockit denominated by BEA as "Limited
Availability" or "Developer Releases," and use of such releases does
not require that you upgrade to a subsequent general availability
release.

5.  Trademarks and Logos. You acknowledge and agree as between you and
BEA that BEA owns JRockit trademarks and logos and other related brand
designations ("BEA Marks"), and you have no right to use, or remove or
efface from JRockit, any of the BEA Marks.  All goodwill associated
with the BEA Marks inures to BEA's benefit.

6.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT
WARRANTY.  ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, CONDITIONS, AND
REPRESENTATIONS, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED.

7.  Limitation of Liability. In no event will BEA or its Licensors be
liable for any lost revenue, profits or data, or for special,
incidental, consequential or other indirect damages, or for punitive
damages, however caused, regardless of the theory of liability,
arising out of or related to JRockit or this Agreement, even if BEA
has been advised of the possibility of such loss. In no event will
BEA's liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including
negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for JRockit
hereunder.

8.  Termination; No Obligation to Support. This Agreement is effective
until terminated. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by
destroying all copies of JRockit. Either party may terminate this
Agreement immediately should JRockit become, or in either party's
opinion be likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement of
any intellectual property right. This Agreement will terminate
immediately without notice from BEA if you fail to comply with any
provision of this Agreement. Upon Termination, you must destroy all
copies of JRockit. BEA may at any time discontinue offering JRockit or
any particular version thereof, and unless you accept the terms of and
pay the applicable support fees for a separate BEA JRockit Support
Addendum, BEA shall have no obligation to provide support, updates,
patches, bug fixes or other enhancements for JRockit or any particular
version thereof.

9.  Export Regulations. You may not download or otherwise export or
re-export JRockit or any underlying information or technology except
in full compliance with all United States and other applicable laws
and regulations.  In particular, but without limitation, neither
JRockit nor the underlying information or technology may be downloaded
or otherwise exported or re-exported, directly or indirectly, (a) into
(or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North
Korea, Syria or Sudan; (b) to anyone on the US Treasury Department's
list of Specially Designated Nationals or Other Blocked Persons, the
US Commerce Department's Denied Parties List, the US Commerce
Department's Entity List, or the US Commerce Department's Unverified
List; or (c) to or for any proliferation-related (nuclear weapons,
missile technology, or chemical/biological weapons) end use.  By
licensing JRockit, you agree to the foregoing, represent and warrant
that you are not (x) located in, under the control of, or acting on
behalf of, or a national or resident of, any such country; (y) on any
such list; or (z) involved in any such end use.

10.  U.S. Government Restricted Rights. If JRockit is being acquired
by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government
contractor, then the Government's rights in JRockit and accompanying
documentation shall be only as set forth in this Agreement in
accordance with 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD)
acquisitions) and with 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD
acquisitions).

11.  Governing Law. Any action related to this Agreement will be
governed by the laws of the United States and the state of
California. Any legal action in any way arising out of or related to
JRockit or this Agreement may be brought exclusively in the state of
federal courts located in San Jose, California.  By accepting this
Agreement, you are consenting to the exclusive jurisdiction of these
courts.

12.  Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
